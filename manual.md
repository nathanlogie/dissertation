## Overview of Adaptive Masking

This GitHub repo serves as the primary location of all code related to my dissertation work, which
proposes a new in-processing bias mitigation strategy in the form of adaptive masking.
 ### Adaptive Masking Description (Extract from Dissertation)

Adaptive masking is a novel in-processing bias mitigation technique designed to respond to bias
as it emerges through the use of masking. This method differs from static masking approaches,
which apply a predefined transformation to sensitive attributes; instead, it responds to bias
throughout the training of a model.

The process begins by partitioning a collection of vectorized document representations into multiple batches, which serve as incremental training units. Each batch is selected based on a predefined strategy, either random selection, correlation-based selection, or distribution-based selection. This partitioning enables regular bias assessment and intervention throughout the training process.
After selecting the first batch, an initial classifier ùê∂ is trained. The classifier is then evaluated
against a held-out set to compute a bias score ùêµ (using metrics such as Statistical Parity Difference
or Equal Opportunity Difference), which quantifies the bias concerning the sensitive attribute ùëÜ.
If ùêµ exceeds a predefined threshold ùúè, the appropriate masking strategy is applied to the subsequent
batch. In the baseline masking approach, the sensitive attribute is replaced by a constant masking
value ùëö, thereby neutralizing its influence. In the expanded masking strategy, additional proxy
attributes that are highly correlated with ùëÜ are masked as well.

Each processed batch‚Äîmasked or unmasked‚Äîis then incorporated into a cumulative training
dataset, which is used to re-train the classifier in subsequent iterations. This iterative procedure
continues until all batches have been processed

## Adaptive Masking and Baseline

The adaptive masking class is defined in the `adaptive_masking` folder with the `adaptivebaseline.py` file defining the class itself, `bias_metrics.py` defining the metric used in the evaluation, and `main.py` providing a function to run and evaluate adaptive masking on a given dataset/model

The baseline is defined in the `baseline` folder with the `baseline.py` file defining the run itself and `main.py` providing a standard run which gives baseline results for the given dataset(s)/model

## Running Experiments

Each experiment has a `main.py` file, which runs all the associated files with that experiment and outputs the results as a `.csv` file in the same directory. All results are already in each directory but are replaced when running the experiment anew
